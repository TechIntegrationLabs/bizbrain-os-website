### Section 2: The Problem

**Headline:**
```
Your Business Is Scattered
```

**Pain Points (3 cards):**

Card 1 - Lost Context:
```
Icon: 🧠 (or brain with question mark)
Title: "Context Dies in Conversations"
Body: "Important decisions buried in Slack. Client preferences lost in email threads. Every new conversation starts from zero."
```

Card 2 - Manual Everything:
```
Icon: ⚙️ (or gear with X)
Title: "You Are the Automation"
Body: "Copy-pasting between tools. Manually updating status docs. Remembering to follow up. Your brain is the integration layer."
```

Card 3 - Tool Chaos:
```
Icon: 📱 (or apps scattered)
Title: "10 Tools, Zero Memory"
Body: "Notion for notes. Slack for chat. Email for clients. Drive for files. None of them talk to each other."
```

---

### Section 3: What Is a Business Brain?

**Headline:**
```
One System That Actually Thinks
```

**Definition Block:**
```
A Business Brain is a folder system enhanced with AI that:
• Ingests raw data (voice notes, emails, documents)
• Extracts and connects context automatically
• Maintains living documentation that updates itself
• Enables intelligent automation across operations
```

**Visual:** Animated diagram showing:
```
[Voice Note] → [Business Brain] → [Updated Docs + Tasks + Context]
```

**Key Differentiator Quote:**
```
"It's not another app to check. It's the system that checks everything for you."
```

---

### Section 4: Interactive Demo - Voice to Context

**Section Headline:**
```
Drop a Voice Note. Watch It Think.
```

**Instructions:**
```
Click "Record" and speak naturally about your business. Watch the brain extract context in real-time.
```

**Demo Scenarios (pre-built examples user can select):**

1. Client Meeting Recap:
```
"Just got off a call with Tim from BuildTrack. He wants to add a new feature for the driver log - needs GPS tracking and mileage calculation. Said budget is around 5K and he wants it by end of January. Also mentioned he's interested in our maintenance tier after launch."
```

2. Project Status Update:
```
"Perdia v5 is about 80% done. Still need to finish the auto-publish feature and fix that bug with the monetization preview. Sarah's handling the content strategy review tomorrow. Should be ready for beta by next Friday."
```

3. Financial Note:
```
"Need to remember - AWS bill came in at $247 this month, higher than expected. Should probably look at optimizing those Lambda functions. Also, GetEducated invoice is 30 days overdue, need to send a reminder."
```
